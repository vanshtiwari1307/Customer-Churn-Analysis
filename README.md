# 📌 Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Dataset<br>
## Objective:<br>
#### To analyze customer behavior and identify the key drivers of churn using data visualization techniques, and to recommend actionable strategies to reduce churn.<br>

## Tools Used:<br>
#### Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook<br>

# Key Highlights:<br>

## 📊 Data Cleaning & Preparation:<br>
Handled missing and incorrect values in fields like TotalCharges.<br>
Converted categorical fields (e.g., SeniorCitizen) for better interpretability.<br>

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>
Analyzed churn distribution across demographic and service-related features like:<br>
SeniorCitizen, Contract, InternetService, TechSupport, Tenure, etc.<br>
Used count plots, histograms, and stacked bar charts to visualize patterns.<br>

## 📈 Findings:<br>
Churn rate is highest among customers with month-to-month contracts and short tenure.<br>
Senior citizens, and customers without support services (OnlineSecurity, TechSupport) are more likely to churn.<br>
Long-term contract holders (1 or 2 years) show much higher retention.<br>

## 💡 Recommendations:<br>
Improve early-stage onboarding for new customers.<br>
Offer discounts or incentives for long-term contracts.<br>
Bundle support services like OnlineSecurity and TechSupport to improve value perception.<br>
Focus retention strategies on at-risk segments like senior citizens and early-tenure users.<br>
